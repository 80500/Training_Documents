	DevOps Stages ::
	
	
	
		Continuous Development :
		
			- It is a capability of Application Team to continuously develop the projects
			- Improve productivity of Developers 
			
			Role of the Developers :::
			
				- Understand the Application Design 
				- coding - source code development (java/python)
				- Build  - It is a process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war / *.jar/ *.exec) 
				- Unit Testing 
				- Promote the changes to higher environments for further testing (QA/UAT)
				- Notify the testing teams to pick the changes for further testing
				
			Using DevOps Approach 
			
				- Code the Application 
				- Update the source code in the Source Code Repository like Github 
				
			Using DevOps Process & Tools Automate :
			
				- Build  - It is a process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war / *.jar/ *.exec) 
				- Unit Testing 
				- Promote the changes to higher environments for further testing (QA/UAT)
				- Notify the testing teams to pick the changes for further testing	

			Tools :::
			
				Eclipse based IDEs - Integrated Development Environment 
				JDK , Python, .Net Core , Angular, NodeJS 
				Build Tools : Maven, Gradle, Ant 
				Unit Testing Tools : JUNIT, TestNG 
				Jenkins Integration 
		
		Continuous Integration ::
			- It is a capability of Application Team to continuously Integrate the code for further testing.
		
			Billing System - Application Project : 4 Functions/Modules  
				Stock Maintainence			Developer1  - Code, build, unit-testing - Promote the code to QA Testing
				Customer Maintainence		Developer2  - Code, build, unit-testing - Promote the code to QA Testing
				Billing 
				Inventory 

			Tools :
			
				Eclipse based IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse / Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio / Pycharm 
				Jenkins 
				Docker, Ansible 
				
		
		Continuous Testing
		
			- It is done using Automated Testing Tools like 

			Tools :
			- JUnit / TestNG / Selenium 
					- Create some test case/test data 				
			- Jenkins 
				
				
		Continuous Delivery / Deployment
			- Both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment are used to release the changes to Production Environments
						
			Continuous Delivery	:
				It expects the Manual approval for the production release 			
			
			Continuous Deployment
				It does not expects the Manual approval for the production release 	

			Tools :
			
				Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes
						
			
		Continuous Monitoring ==> Used to achieve Business Continuity
		
			Infra-Structure Monitoring 
				Production Servers to be monitored 
					CPU/Memory/Traffic
					
			Tools :
				Prometheus / Grafana / Splunk / Nagios / Dynatace 
	
		www.amazon.com ==> E_Commerce Portal		
	
			Application Monitoring
			
				App-Dynamics / Datadog
	
	
	
		Infra-Structure Management :::
		
		Infra-Structure Management Team 
			Provision Infra-Structure 
				Create the Servers 
				Configure the servers 
				
			Tools : 
			
				IAC Tools - Infra-Structure As Code :
				
					Terraform 		- Provisioning/Creating the Servers 
					
					Ansible 		- Configuration Management and deployments 
				
		
			
	Environments ::
	
	Non-Prod Environments																	Prod Environment
	
		Dev Environment - Local Machine(Laptop)
		Testing Environment
			QA  Quality Assurance Testing 
				functional/integration/regression....
			UAT	User Acceptance Testing											-->				Production Environment(Servers)
				This testing will be done using LIVE production data.
				business users
			
	Continuous Delivery / Deployment
		- Both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment are used to release the changes to Production Environments
					
		Continuous Delivery	:
			It expects the Manual approval for the production release 
			Expect the Downtime. 


		On-Banking Services ::: Net-Banking / On Credit Card Transaction 
		
			Release some new feature / Fix some issues in the Production Environment 
			
				Fix the Production Release Window (4 - 6 Hrs.)  - Current V1.1
				Weekends / Mid-Night / Early Mornings 
				
				d/t/r/s/i Teams --> give approval for production release  V1.2 
					if the production release failed, 
						- fix the issue with the release window.
						- Revert the Changes
		
		Continuous Deployment
			It does not expects the Manual approval for the production release 	
			Release the products and features without any downtime

		Tools :		
			Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes		
		
		Facebook/Netflix/Google/www.amazon.com
		
			Very Matured level of DevOps strategies/Process to achieve Continuous Deployment.
			
			
		How to Achieve Continuous Deployment :::
		
			Application Architecture ::
			
				Monolith Application Architecture 
					- Tightly coupled applications 
					- It has all the dependencies tightly coupled 
					
				Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :
					- Loosely coupled Applications
					- Here the Modules/Functions/Iterations are considered as micro-service.
					- These micro-services can be independently developed, build, tested and deployed to production.
					
					
		www.amazon.com - E_Commerce Portal :::
			Web Application:
				Function:
		
		Sign_up			micro-service1 - developer1 - independently code, build, unit-test, promote the changes to testing & Production Environments 
		Sign_in			micro-service2 - developer2 - independently code, build, unit-test, promote the changes to testing & Production Environments

		Build Tools - Maven 
				Maven Build Tools 
					- Create Maven Console and Web Applications
					- Create Maven Springboot Web Applications 
					
		Build Tools - Maven - used to build Java applications 
		
		Using Maven : 
			Application Build - Compile the code, create artifacts, perform unit-testing 

				- Build  - It is a process of compiling the source code and create artifacts(Binaries - *.war / *.jar/ *.exec) 
				- Unit Testing
				
		Jdk - 
		
		Maven 
		
		Eclipse IDE -- Is basically meant for Java Application Development.
					- Create Maven Console and Web Applications
					- Create Maven Springboot Web Applications 

		Maven Project :
		
			pom.xml 	- Project Object Model 
				- Will be part of the Java Application Project
				- It is used to define the properties of application artifacts 
				- It is used to define dependencies and the plugins required to perform build/unit-testing
				
			Maven Goals : Actions we perform
				● mvn clean - to clean the target folder.
				● mvn compile - to compile the source code
				● mvn test - to compile and execute junit test cases
				● mvn package - to compile, test and create artifacts
				● mvn install - to install the package to local repository.
				● mvn deploy - to deploy the package from local repository to remote repository.

			mvn clean package

	Fundamentals of SQL :::
	
	SQL : ---> Structured Query Language!
	
	What is Data ? 
	
		Is a raw fact.
	
	INDIA 
	
	Information :
	
		Processed Data 
	
	INDIA is a Country 
	

	To store a raw text, What we use ?
	
		Memory/Volume/Address space :
		
		Variable Is an identifier of the data item stored in a memory location.
		
		country = "India"
		
		File:
		
		country.txt 
		
			INDIA is a Country
			
			INDIA 
		
		File System -> Is sequential form.
			It is used for Batch Process. Bulk Data Transfer/Load.
			
			json / yaml / xml 
			
		Transaction Data ::::
			
				Random mode of data transfer using the key field.
				
				
		Database Management System :

			System that helps to manage the data in the from of Tables 
			
			
		Database : It is a collection of Tables 
		
		Tables   : It is a Rows and Columns 
		
		Table Students_Info:

		Stud_Adm_no		Stud_Name		Contact_Number		Email_Id			Course_Name
		
		1001			zzzzzz			1231231231			asdfa@asd.com		DevOps 
		1002			cccccc			123123123			asw@asd.com			ML
		ddddddddd		1003
		
		
		Relational Database Management System 
		
			MySQL Database Server 
			Oracle 
			
		RDBMS uses SQL - Structured Query Language to create and Manage the Database and its components
		
		Application Architecture :::
		
		3-tier Application Architecture 
		
			Web_site : User_Registration
		
			Front_End Design Layer		# Helps the End-Users to access the Application in GUI(Grapical User Interface) Mode 
			
			Application Layer			# Used to Create the Application Logic and Validations 
			
			Back_End(DataBase) Layer	# Used to Store/manage/retrieve the Data in Database
			
			
		2-tier Application Architecture
		
			Front_End
			
			Application Layer 
		
		1-tier Application Architecture
		
			Blog sites / articles - Static web page 
		
		In Applications
			
			SQL is used in the Application Layer to interact with Database.
		

		SQL Installation ::

			Referential Integrity Constraint 
					Before Insert/update/ check the parent table.
					Before Delete check the entries in child table.
